## Challenge_12

In this program, I've used various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. Youâ€™ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. You will be able to use a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset, original and resampled.

## Technologies

https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html

This project leverages python 3.7, imbalanced-learn and PyDotPlus libraries. You will install Install imbalanced-learn and PyDotPlus by installing in your conda dev environment in your terminal.

conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn
conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus
